# Guilloch√©.js

Having recently read a blog post on guilloches, I became intrigued and the post inspired me to recreate them.  They are beautiful patterns, and the starting formula to draw a rosette looked very simple to replicate in an HTML5 canvas.  The 30 minute project quickly took off into a several hour excursion into the beauty of animated guilloches.
